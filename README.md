#  8-bit Microcontroller Design in Verilog

I'm excited to share my recent project where I designed and implemented an 8-bit microcontroller using Verilog! This project was part of my 30-day internship at Anmayan Technologies, Manipal, and it was an incredible learning experience.

Key Features:

- Designed and implemented a simple 8-bit microcontroller with a Program Counter (PC), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Logic, and memory modules (DMem and PMem)
- Developed testbenches for simulating and verifying the microcontroller's functionality using ModelSim
- Implemented instructions like Load, Store, Add, and NOP, and demonstrated their execution

Technologies Used:

- Verilog (HDL)
- ModelSim (Simulation and Verification)

What I Learned:

- Gained hands-on experience with digital design and verification
- Developed problem-solving skills and attention to detail
- Improved understanding of computer architecture and microcontroller design

I'm proud to have completed this project and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow with Anmayan Technologies.
